This is a two player web fighting game made using HTML and JavaScript. Initially the game is started with a countdown timer, health bars for each player, player 1 to the left, and player 2 to the right.

Controls for player 1 are as follows:
  d: move right 
  a: move left 
  w: jump 
  spacebar: attack

Controls for player 2 are as follows: 
right arrow: move right 
left arrow: move left 
arrow up: jump 
arrow down: attack

If the health bars for both players are the same at the end of the timer, the game is a tie. If the health bar for player 1 is greater than player 2 at the end of the timer, or player 2's health bar is zero at any point, player 1 wins. If the health bar for player 2 is greater than player 1 at the end of the timer, or player 1's health bar is zero at any point, player 2 wins.
